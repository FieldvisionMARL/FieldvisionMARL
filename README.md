## What problem are we solving?

Agricultrual drones generate massive amounts of high-resolution imagery that must be processed in real-time for tasks like crop counting, health monitoring, and anomaly detection. But two practical challenges block effective development:

1 **Dynamic network conditions**: Drones flying over fields experience constantly changing wireless connectivity-bandwidth fluctuates, latency spikes, and connections drop. Static offloading rules fail under these conditions.

2 **Multi-drone coordination**: When multiple drones share edge and cloud resources, independent decision-making leads to congestion, resource contention, and degraded performance. Explicit inter-drone communication is often impractical in large agricultural environments.
